    Simone's Priorities
</h1>

<h2>
    Strong Public Schools - <a href="#!/schoolView">Learn More</a>
</h2>

<p>
    Public education is a treasured American value and the key to unlocking the American Dream. But if
    Douglas County were a state we would rank 49th for per-pupil student funding - only Utah gets less.
    The dramatic funding shortfalls were exacerbated by the previous school board's mismanagement which
    lead to some of our best teachers leaving the district and 11 local schools coming under state improvement
    plans. Our children deserve better.

<h2>
    Cheap, Clean, Energy - <a href="#!/energyView">Learn More</a>
</h2>

<p>
    Power generation through renewable methods is now cheaper than power generation through fossil fuels.
    We need to support incentives to make Colorado a hub for manufacturing and utilization of renewable energy,
    which will create jobs while lowering power bills.
</p>

<h2>
    Affordable, Accessible, Healthcare - <a href="#!/healthView">Learn More</a>
</h2>

<p>
    Per-capita healthcare costs are rising precipitously in America. Simone can leverage her industry
    experience to help us pursue non-partisan, practical, solutions to cut costs and improve public health.
    Whether you love or hate the idea of UHC it isn't happening soon. But there are many smaller things we
    can do <b>now</b> which will make a big difference.
</p>

<h2>
    Growth and Infrastructure - <a href="#!/growthView">Learn More</a>
</h2>

<p>
    Colorado is one of the fastest growing states in the nation. We need to take charge of urban planning
    to preserve our quality of life.  Colorado is about hiking, biking, skiing, and riding in the fresh mountain air.
    Not sitting in traffic.
