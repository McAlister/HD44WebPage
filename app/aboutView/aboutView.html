<h2>
    Simone's childhood dream was to be a rocket scientist. But life doesn't always work out
    like you planned.
</h2>

<p>
    Simone moved to Golden from Colorado Springs in 1997 to attend Colorado School of Mines.
    She started as a Physics major, but once she took a computer programming course she was hooked.
    She switched majors and graduated with honors in Math and Computer Science, with a minor in Physics.
    The year was 2001, just in time for the tech bubble to burst. Like many of today's millennials,
    she took whatever work she could find to make rent after graduation. Luckily for her,
    the programming job market had recovered by 2003. Additionally, in 1997 you could attend School
    of Mines for $2,500 a semester (a THIRD of what it costs today). Dorm, food, book, and student fees are
    likewise much higher now than inflation can justify. Simone believes our children should have the
    same opportunities we did.

<h2>
    Simone is a fighter. She will fight for you.
</h2>

<p>
    It took Simone over a decade to get from the IT helpdesk at the National Park Service to writing
    ground control software for GPS Satellites at Raytheon. She never gave up.
    Along the way she wrote code in a variety
    of politically sensitive industries including email security, geological surveying, health insurance
    claims processing, and defense contracting. Programmers get a great perspective on the industries
    they work for. To create the systems that everyone uses, they need end-to-end knowledge of workflows
    at a practical level. They have deep industry knowledge without
    deep financial ties. Simone has worked both with extremely large systems serving millions of users,
    and mission critical systems responsible for human safety. She understands how to balance
    the desire to improve things with respect for the functionality of existing systems. Ideologues tend to
    forget that you need to understand something before you seek to change it.
</p>

<p>
    Who better to deal with a lobbyist than someone who knows enough about their
    industries to catch them when they leave out critical context?
    And who knows better than a programmer that what you wrote doesn't always do what you intended?
</p>

<h2>
    Simone believes in looking for solutions, not villains.
</h2>

<p>
    Our political discourse has become consumed with hatred and spite. Every question, every issue, gets disconnected
    from the solvable, real-world, problems in front of us and becomes an ideological battle against some enemy. Radical
    politicians—on both sides—spend their time playing the blame game. They demonize a section of the population,
    declare them the author of all our woes, then promise that things will magically be better if we can just properly
    punish "those people." Who "those people" are varies depending on who you talk to, but what is nearly universal is
    that the proposals to punish "them" don’t actually address our real problems in any meaningful way. This attitude
    is a distraction from <b>real</b> solutions - as scapegoating always is. Responsible politicians - on both sides - are then
    savaged by their respective radicals for the sin of not hating "those people" enough.
</p>

<p>
    Simone Aiken will not play that game. She is a geek, and an engineer. She only wants to <b>fix</b> things.
